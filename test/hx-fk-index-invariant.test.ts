// An unindexed foreign key is a latent outage, not a style question. Postgres
// enforces a cascade (and a restrict/no-action check) by looking up referencing
// rows ONCE PER AFFECTED PARENT ROW; with no covering index each lookup is a
// sequential scan of the whole child table.
//
// On prod that arithmetic was: hx.tool_calls.turn_id had no index, so a
// guarantor rebuild deleting ~2,000 turns from hx.turns ran ~2,000 sequential
// scans of a 546 MB table. Every rebuild ran until the 120 s statement_timeout
// killed it, holding a background connection the whole time, which starved the
// 2-connection pool and failed ~80% of all repair work.
//
// EXPLAIN cannot warn you: cascade work is trigger work, so the delete's own
// plan looks like a cheap Index Scan. Only the catalog shows it. Hence this
// test — it is the only thing standing between the next FK and a repeat.
