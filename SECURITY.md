# Security Policy

`hx-fortress` runs on customer infrastructure. It holds enrollment tokens, an
Ed25519 signing key, object-storage credentials, AI session transcripts, and the
administration console for all of it. We take security reports seriously and
appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest released version receives security fixes. This project is
pre-1.0.

| Version        | Supported          |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| latest release | :white_check_mark: |
| older releases | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report privately through either channel:

- **Preferred:** GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting — the "Report a
  vulnerability" button under this repository's **Security** tab.
- **Email:** [security@<domain>] (PGP key: [link/fingerprint]).

Please include: affected version/commit, a description and impact assessment,
and reproduction steps or a proof-of-concept where possible. Findings against
the enrollment, signing-key, capability-token, console-session, self-update, or
storage-credential paths are prioritized.

## Scope

In scope: this repository's source and released binaries. Out of scope:
third-party dependencies (report upstream), social engineering, and physical
attacks. The wire-protocol types live in `hx-protocol`; the client daemon in
`hx`.

# Threat model

This section describes what the shipped code does. The properties it names are
ones this repository's tests assert; where a property does not hold, it is
written down under **Known residuals** rather than omitted.

## The two ways in

**The terminal.** Every `hx-fortress` verb runs without a credential. That is
deliberate: anyone who can run them already has the host, its files and its
process table, so a prompt would protect nothing and would put secrets in shell
history and in `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`. The CLI therefore never accepts a password
at all — `ui user create` and `ui user reset` print a one-time setup URL for the
person to open, and `ui config set databaseUrl` reads the DSN from stdin and
refuses a positional argument by name.

**The browser.** Every console session belongs to a named local account with one
of two roles, `operator` or `readonly`. Accounts are created from the terminal
and live in a 0600 `users.json` beside the console, with argon2id password
hashes. There is no credential-free browser path and no way to create an account
from the browser.

Role decides capability. `readonly` reaches every read; `operator` additionally
reaches the two write routes. The decision is made once, at a single gate every
request passes through, and a path that no route classifies is treated as a
write — so a route added without a decision is locked to operators rather than
quietly open.

## What is served before a session exists

The application shell, its content-hashed assets, `/healthz`, a loopback-only
identity handshake that answers `{"app":"hx-fortress-ui"}`, and four
authentication routes (sign-in, SSO exchange, setup status, setup completion).
Nothing else. No version, no organization, no configuration value, and no path
on the box.

An unauthenticated request to a path that does not exist is answered exactly
like one to a path that does — 401, same sentence. The difference between the
two would otherwise be a map of the console's surface, drawn by anyone who can
reach the port.

## The SSO trust boundary

The workbench's "Open fortress console" button carries an Ed25519 grant minted
by let.ai and verified offline against the per-org public key the hub pushed
over the tunnel. Signature first, then purpose, then organization, then origin
and expiry.

A **valid** grant produces four fields: an entry-record id, the workbench
subject, the organization id, and the operator's banner phrase. It produces no
session and no token. The entry id is a server-side annotation — the sign-in
stamps the workbench identity from the record it names, never from anything the
client sends — and presenting it as a session token is refused like any other
unknown token.

So a compromised let.ai can mint a grant, open a tab, and land on a sign-in
form. It cannot read a session, a count, a transcript or a configuration value,
and it cannot change anything: every capability comes from a fortress-local
account whose password the cloud never holds.

`ui.sso` is off by default and is enabled by a local gesture. It requires an
https `publicUrl`: `hx-fortress ui sso on` refuses without one rather than
warning, and the console advertises its URL to let.ai only while all three of
enablement, `sso` and an https public URL hold.

## Token lifecycle

| Token | Minted by | Carried in | Lifetime | Ends when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Setup URL | `ui user create` / `ui user reset`, printed to the terminal | the URL **fragment**, so it never reaches a request line, an access log or a `Referer` | 24 hours | the password is set, a newer link is issued, or the account is disabled, deleted or reset |
| Session token | the sign-in that returns it | the `x-fortress-ui-token` request header, held in `sessionStorage` per tab | an absolute and an idle budget, both from `ui.json` | sign-out, either budget, a console restart, `ui user disable`/`delete`/`reset`, or a role change |
| Console grant | let.ai | the SSO exchange request body | minutes, set by the minter | it is exchanged once — `jti` is single-use |
| Capability token | let.ai | `Authorization: Bearer` on the ingest/read gateway | minutes, set by the minter | its own expiry |

Session tokens are 256 bits from the system CSPRNG. They appear in exactly one
place — the JSON body of the response that minted them — and never in a URL, a
redirect or a log line. The server stores only a SHA-256 digest, in the serving
process's memory: a restart revokes every session, and nothing on disk can be
stolen and replayed. Cookies are not used, which is what keeps cross-site
request forgery from being a category here; writes additionally carry an Origin
check that fails closed on an absent or `null` header.

Revocation performed by another process — the CLI writing `users.json` — rides
epochs that are re-read on every single request, so a disabled account stops
working on its next call rather than when its session happens to expire.

## The two realms do not cross

The console and the ingest/read gateway are separate authentication realms with
separate verifiers. A capability token reaches no `/ui/api/*` route on either
header, a console session reaches no gateway route, and a console grant is
refused by both — the gateway rejects its purpose outright, and the console door
mints nothing but an annotation. This is asserted in both directions.

## The metadata-only boundary

With the bundled Postgres, the console's database role holds:

- column-level `SELECT` on `hx.sessions` that **excludes** `last_user_text` and
  `last_assistant_text`;
- column-level `SELECT` on `hx.embeddings` that **excludes** the vector and
  `content_hash` — an embedding is a lossy encoding of the text it was computed
  from, and a hash of that text is a membership oracle over it;
- **no** privilege on `hx.turns`, `hx.tool_calls`, `hx.session_agents`, or on
  any view (views are owner-rights and read straight past a column grant, so
  every one of them is denied);
- `SELECT` and `INSERT` on the command queue and the audit table, and `SELECT`
  and nothing else on every table the daemon's engines own.

A console compromise is therefore not a transcript disclosure. The whole matrix
is asserted against a live catalog on every pull request, on the second boot —
the blanket grant that every boot re-issues must not undo a revoke.

The console does render the organization's roster and per-person session counts
to any signed-in account, including `readonly`. That is a deliberate product
decision, not an oversight: the people, adoption and device views exist to
answer who in the organization is covered, and suppressing them would be
theatre against an operator who has root on the box. The boundary is who gets
an account.

## The daemon runtime plane

Everything the console asks the daemon to do is a row in `hx.console_commands`,
and the two processes reach that table with different authority.

The console's role, `hx_ui`, is the only one that may `INSERT` there. The
daemon's role, `hx_app_rw`, is the one every cloud-reachable path runs as — the
tunnel, the gateway, each ingest entry point — and it holds no `INSERT`, no
`UPDATE` and no `DELETE` on that table at all. The same revoke covers
`hx.admin_audit`, `hx.audit_acks`, `hx.audit_settings` and `hx.ingest_control`.
An adversary who reaches that role over the network therefore cannot ask this
host to update itself, rotate a credential, move its storage or acknowledge a
residency finding: the row that would carry the request is one it cannot write.

The daemon still has to move rows it did not mint — claim one, finish it, reject
it — and it does that through five `SECURITY DEFINER` routines:

| Routine | What it may do |
| --- | --- |
| `hx.claim_command` | `requested` → `running`, or re-drive a row this daemon already had in flight |
| `hx.complete_command` | `running` → `done` or `failed`, and nothing else |
| `hx.reject_command` | non-terminal → `rejected` |
| `hx.acknowledge_finding` | write one residency acknowledgement |
| `hx.set_cloud_witness` | flip the cloud-witness setting |

Each enforces a one-way state machine — a terminal row is final, and no argument
shape moves it back — and none can change a row's `kind`, its parameters or its
requested time. `EXECUTE` is revoked from `PUBLIC` in the same transaction that
creates each routine, and granted to `hx_app_rw` alone.

They are owned by `hx_cmd_owner`, a `NOLOGIN` role created for this and nothing
else, and deliberately not the cluster superuser: a `SECURITY DEFINER` body runs
with its owner's rights, so a superuser-owned routine would turn a defect in a
body into control of the cluster, and the caller here is the one principal this
fence exists to constrain. Each routine pins
`search_path = pg_catalog, pg_temp` and schema-qualifies every reference,
because an unqualified name in such a body otherwise resolves through the
*caller's* search path. `hx_cmd_owner` holds `SELECT, UPDATE` on the command
queue and `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE` on the two audit tables — no `INSERT` on the
queue, so minting stays with the console — and it is a member of nothing and has
no members.

The role, the routines, the ownership, the `PUBLIC` revoke and the grants are
re-applied on every boot rather than written once by a migration. A migration
runs before the role it would grant to exists, aborts an upgrade on an external
Postgres whose operator role cannot take ownership, and — the journal being
keyed by name — could never correct a routine it had already recorded. The same
boot drops stale overloads: `CREATE OR REPLACE` is keyed on the argument types,
so a changed signature would leave the previous routine alive, still owned and
still granted, still enforcing the previous state machine. Every property in
this section is asserted against the live catalog on the second boot.

All of it is embedded-Postgres only; see **Console containment is
EMBEDDED-Postgres only** below.

## Rate limiting, lockout, and the load ceilings

- Sign-in counters are keyed on `(login, remote-key)`. A lockout is never
  organization-wide and never permanent: repeated failures buy an exponentially
  growing delay with a 15-minute ceiling, because a permanent lock is a
  denial-of-service an attacker can aim at the operator.
- A process-wide sign-in ceiling sheds load above every per-principal budget.
- Password verification runs through a bounded argon2id gate that keeps a slot
  reserved for a remote with no recent failures, so a genuine sign-in gets
  through a flood.
- `X-Forwarded-For` is honoured **only** when the immediate peer is a configured
  trusted proxy, and the walk goes rightmost-to-left, so entries an attacker
  prepends are never reached. With no trusted proxy configured the header is
  ignored entirely; `hx-fortress ui config` prints which address the limits are
  actually keyed on, because the default is otherwise a silent failure behind
  any platform edge.
- Request bodies are capped at 256 KiB by the listener, before any handler runs.
- Live event streams are capped per session, per account, and process-wide, and
  every stream a session holds is closed the moment that session is dropped.

## Browser-facing responses

Every response class carries `Content-Security-Policy` (with SHA-256 hashes for
the shell's inline scripts, so `script-src` needs no `'unsafe-inline'`, and with
`frame-ancestors 'none'`, `base-uri 'none'` and `form-action 'none'`),
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` and a
`Cache-Control` directive. `Strict-Transport-Security` is sent only where the
request actually arrived on a configured https host — asserting it on a
plain-http console would pin a browser to a scheme that console cannot serve.

The single exception is the event stream, which is a body already flowing when
those headers would be set: it carries `nosniff`, the referrer policy and
`no-store`, and not the CSP, which is a directive for documents.

The `Host` header is checked per request against an allowlist rebuilt from a
live read of `ui.json`. Literal loopback is accepted on any port — a published
container maps 8788 onto some other host port — and a configured public host is
accepted on its own port alone. A name nobody configured is refused, which is
what closes DNS rebinding.

## What a browser can change

Exactly two routes, and one acknowledgement:

- `POST /ui/api/service` — start, stop or restart the daemon's unit.
- `POST /ui/api/commands` — mint one row in the command queue, whose `kind` must
  be one of the eight the console offers a control for.
- `POST /ui/api/report/proof-copy` — record that a residency proof was copied.

There is no configuration-write endpoint under any spelling, no account
management, and no way to change what this console itself is configured with.
Configuration, account lifecycle and SSO advertisement are terminal verbs, and
the command plane refuses a configuration key as a parameter.

A credential a command needs — the storage migration's target keys, a rotation's
replacement — never travels in the row. The request body carries it once, the
console writes it to a single-use `0600` file, and the row carries a 32-hex
reference the daemon reads and unlinks in one step. The row is durable and
readable by everything holding `SELECT`; the secret it points at is neither.

## Where the audit trail lives

Every console act is written to a 0600 append-only JSONL spool owned by the
serving process before it is mirrored into Postgres. The intent record is
fsynced **before** the mutation runs and the outcome is appended after — an
append-only pair, never an in-place amend, so a crash between them leaves an
intent nothing answers, which is the honest state.

Failed public authentication attempts are collapsed: one record per
`(login, source, 5-minute window)` carrying the final count, and attempts a rate
bucket refused append nothing at all. Otherwise a flood could make this host
write to disk as fast as it can send packets, into a table with no `DELETE`
anywhere in the system.

# Known residuals

These are properties of the design, not open bugs. They are stated here so an
operator can decide about them rather than discover them.

## Command outcomes are corroborated, not trusted

The daemon's Postgres authority IS the cloud-reachable write role. The role
cannot mint a command and cannot alter one — every transition runs through a
`SECURITY DEFINER` routine owned by a NOLOGIN role that holds nothing else — but
the routines are `EXECUTE`-granted to it by necessity, so an adversary holding
that role can call them directly: report a rotation that never ran, or deny one
that did.

There is no SQL-layer fix. Any nonce the routine could check is one the same
role could rotate.

So the row is not the evidence. The daemon writes every transition it actually
performs to the 0600 spool — a file that role cannot reach — and the console
compares the two. A terminal outcome with no matching record renders as
**REPORTED (unconfirmed)**, never as success; one contradicted by a record
renders as **DISPUTED**, names which way the disagreement runs, links the trail
entry, and gives the remediation. The residual is that forgery is made *visible*
rather than *impossible*.

## Console containment is EMBEDDED-Postgres only

Against an **external Postgres** (`FORTRESS_DATABASE_URL`) both fences above are
**void**. There is no role split to enforce, the operator's role OWNS the tables
— an owner cannot be constrained by `REVOKE` and bypasses any routine with plain
DML — and the apparatus is never created there at all. Console mutations still
work; they are simply not contained, and the console says so on the pages that
depend on them.

The metadata-only column boundary is not applied there either: the grants that
create it are issued by the embedded provider's boot, which never runs against
an external DSN. Unless the operator provisioned a restricted console role
themselves, the console connects with whatever privilege the DSN carries.

Remediation for all three: run the daemon under a NON-OWNING role.
`hx-fortress ui config --print-role-sql` emits that script — table DML only,
`SELECT, UPDATE` on the command queue and never `INSERT`, so minting stays with
the console role the same script creates, and the same column-scoped `SELECT`
on `hx.sessions` that the embedded boot issues.

## The console process holds a bucket-write-capable key

The fortress has ONE storage credential for both reads and writes, and signing
the console's `HEAD`/`LIST`/`GetBucketVersioning` calls requires exactly the
secret half of it. The console is given the storage block minus the OpenAI key;
the storage credential it does hold can also write.

## A downgrade window is not audit-trustworthy

The console-table `REVOKE`s are carried both by the migration and by every boot.
An OLDER binary re-grants the write role full DML on its first boot through its
blanket schema grant, so audit rows written while a downgraded binary was
running are untrusted. A command row planted during such a window is rejected by
the boot fence of the binary that comes back — it is never executed — but the
rows the downgraded binary wrote are still there.

## A console restart re-opens replay for an unexchanged grant

Exchanged grants are remembered by `jti` in the serving process's memory, which
is all the set has to outlive. A restart inside a grant's own TTL therefore
forgets it, and a grant that was captured but never exchanged could be exchanged
afterwards. What that buys is one more sign-in form.

## The console binds dual-stack inside a container

Outside a container, a non-loopback bind is refused unless an https
`FORTRESS_UI_PUBLIC_URL` is set or `--allow-insecure-bind` is passed, and the
residual is printed. Inside a detected docker-class container with
`FORTRESS_UI_ENABLE`, the console binds dual-stack so the documented
`-p 127.0.0.1:8788:8788` publish works with no extra gesture. The Host allowlist
and the local account credentials are the boundary there. System containers
(lxc, nspawn) are LAN-routable and have no publish indirection, so they require
the explicit gesture like any host.

# Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who act in good faith,
avoid privacy violations and service disruption, and give us a reasonable
opportunity to remediate before public disclosure.
