//
// SIGNALLING IS GUARDED BY IDENTITY, NOT BY LIVENESS. A loopback probe would
// only prove that SOMETHING is listening on the port; a bare `kill(pid, 0)`
// would only prove that SOMETHING has that number. The kernel recycles pids
// inside one boot, and the likeliest recycler in this container is
// `hx-fortress host` — the one process a console shutdown must never touch.
//
// The supervisor is also the PARENT, which hands it one fact it does not have to
// infer: it watched the child exit. That observation outranks everything below,
// and it is what carries the case a start token cannot — a slim image with
// neither /proc nor `ps` leaves the record UNPROVEN, and a bare pid check there
// is exactly the guard that is no guard.
