// `hx-fortress audit` — the two terminal verbs the corrective rung depends on.
//
// Neither of them touches the database. `audit witness on|off` writes its intent
// and SIGNALS the daemon, which holds the credential and executes the fenced
// routine; `audit acks reconcile` joins the daemon's PUBLISHED acknowledgements
// against the 0600 audit spool this host already owns. Giving the CLI a database
// credential would turn hx_ui from "the console process" into "the console
// process and every shell on this host", which is the containment story the
// whole command plane rests on.
//
// Without these two verbs the corrective rung asks an operator to hand-parse
// JSONL and join it to a table they cannot query.
