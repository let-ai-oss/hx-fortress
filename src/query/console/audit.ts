// nothing, and neither endpoint is spool-logged. That is deliberate and it is
// not an oversight: a self-auditing panel on a poll would grow a table that has
// no DELETE anywhere in the system, so the trail's own size would become a
// function of how often somebody looked at it. What IS audited is the EXPORT,
// because an export is the only way a full-range copy of the trail leaves the
// box, and a trail that cannot say which copy left is not a trail.
//
// Range and filter are enforced HERE, in the statement, never trimmed after the
// rows come back. A server that fetches everything and then slices has already
// paid the cost the bound exists to prevent.
