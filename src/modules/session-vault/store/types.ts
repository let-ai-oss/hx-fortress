// SessionStore — the storage abstraction behind hx-vision session blobs.
//
// One interface, several implementations, chosen per-org by ./index.ts:
//   • GcsStore         — Google Cloud Storage (let.ai's bucket, or a customer's)
//   • S3Store          — AWS S3 (added in P2)
//   • RemoteVaultStore — RPCs to a customer-hosted vault over the tunnel (P4)
//
// Call sites never touch a cloud SDK directly — they resolve a store and call
// these four methods. Object paths are identical across every implementation
// ({userId}/{family}/{sessionId}/…): org isolation lives at the bucket/store
// level, so a self-hosted vault's dedicated bucket needs no orgId in the path.
