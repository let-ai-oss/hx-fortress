// GuardedStore — a SessionStore decorator that gives every storage call a hard
// deadline and rebuilds the inner store (fresh SDK client + HTTP agent pool)
// after consecutive breaches.
//
// Exists because of the 2026-07-30 prod incident: one GCS 500 left the
// client's keep-alive pool holding hung requests; with no per-call deadline
// every later write waited forever behind them, the cloud's 30 s tunnel RPC
// timeout abandoned each call unanswered, and ingest sat at zero for three
// hours while Postgres-backed reads stayed green and this process logged
// nothing. A deadline turns a hung call into a loud, retryable error; the
// rebuild evicts the poisoned pool; together they make the write path
// self-healing instead of restart-dependent.
//
// A losing call cannot be cancelled (the storage SDKs expose no abort seam) —
// it is detached with a swallow-handler and its client discarded by the
// rebuild; its eventual settle is neither observed nor trusted.
