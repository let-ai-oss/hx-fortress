/** Refused by name, on a Postgres this fortress does not own.
 *
 *  The five SECURITY DEFINER routines are created by `ensureAppRoles`, which is
 *  wired only into the EMBEDDED path — there is no role split on an operator's
 *  own database, so nothing creates them there. The gateway called them anyway:
 *  every claim raised `42883 function hx.claim_command does not exist`, every
 *  poll pass swallowed it, and commands minted from the console sat at
 *  `requested` until their deadline while the daemon reported healthy. An
 *  operator watching a console that accepts a command and never runs it has no
 *  way to learn why.
 *
 *  So the plane says what is true: it cannot run commands here. Reads are
 *  unaffected — the console's whole read surface works on an external DSN — and
 *  ingest is untouched, which is why this refuses rather than failing boot. */
