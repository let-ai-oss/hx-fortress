// historical copy also exists at let.ai. Collapsing the two would either raise
// a permanent alarm about bytes that predate the fortress, or bury a genuine
// delivery failure under a label an operator has learned to acknowledge.
//
// Severity is LAYERED, not contradictory. Per SESSION, `also_at_letai` fails the
// residency check until it is acknowledged. In the FLEET roll-up an acknowledged
// one qualifies the verdict and never fails it. `not_delivered_here` is never
// downgraded by an acknowledgement — an acknowledgement says "we know why a copy
// exists there", and no answer to that question makes a missing object present.
