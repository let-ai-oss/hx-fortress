// The residency audit: what this fortress claims to hold, checked against what
// it actually holds, and against what let.ai says it delivered.
//
// Shape of a run, and why:
//
//   LIST FIRST, HEAD ONLY THE SUSPECTS. One bucket listing answers "is it there"
//   for every session at the cost of a few requests; a HEAD per session would
//   cost one request per session and produce the same answer for the ones the
//   listing already found. The HEADs are spent on the disagreements.
//
//   THE WITNESS IS ASKED ABOUT ELIGIBLE SESSIONS ONLY. A session's id is a piece
//   of this organization's data, and it leaves the box only for sessions that
//   REACHED this fortress THROUGH let.ai, which already saw the id. Everything
//   else is reported as unchecked, by name, and counted.
//
//   EVERY OUTBOUND CALL IS BUDGETED. The limiter is the reason an audit of a
//   large fortress cannot become an outage of it.
