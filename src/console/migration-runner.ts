// Wiring one storage migration to a live fortress: its two buckets, its pause
// plane, its credentials file and its run record.
//
// Kept apart from the engine for the reason the audit runner is: the engine's
// ORDER — copy, delta, drain, barrier, fence, cut — is the part that has to be
// provable, and it stays testable without a bucket, a database or a credential.
//
// Three commands, one lifecycle:
//
//   ARM copies, then engages the short-TTL floor. It is where the long work
//   happens and where nothing is held: ingest runs at full speed throughout, and
//   the floor engages only at the END, so the signatures minted at the old TTL
//   run off while the operator reads the result rather than inside the swap.
//
//   SWAP is the cut, and it is short by construction because ARM already paid
//   for the run-off. It refuses rather than cuts whenever the store did not go
//   quiet or the pause was nearly spent.
//
//   RESUME is the way back out: it releases the floor and clears the pause
//   episode, whether or not anything was switched. Resuming an interrupted COPY
//   is not this — that is ARM again, which re-derives its work from the two
//   buckets and skips what the target already holds.
//
// THE FLOOR HAS ONE OWNER. The engine may raise it and never lowers it: a swap
// that refused is a swap the operator will retry, and lowering the floor would
// charge that retry the whole staging TTL a second time. It is lowered here, on
// a completed cut and on resume. It also lives in memory, so a daemon restart
// clears it — which is the bound on an arm nobody ever followed up.
