// The audit engine's witness, as it actually reaches let.ai.
//
// The direction is fixed by the protocol: the FORTRESS asks and the hub answers
// (`fortressQuery` rides the fortress→hub union), because `letaiCopy` is a fact
// about the hub's own session rows that this box cannot see.
//
// Two properties this adapter exists to hold:
//
//   AN UNANSWERED QUESTION IS NOT A NEGATIVE ANSWER. Every failure the transport
//   has — a timeout, a closed socket, a saturated registry, and above all a hub
//   too old to recognise the frame, which answers nothing at all — collapses to
//   `null`. The engine renders that as "the witness was not asked", by name. A
//   `false` in its place would print "let.ai reports no copy" about a question
//   nobody ever put.
//
//   A PARTIAL ANSWER IS ALSO NOT AN ANSWER. Ids go out in batches, and a batch
//   that fails after earlier ones succeeded abandons the whole run's witness
//   rather than returning what came back: the sessions in the failed batch would
//   otherwise be absent from `copies` for the same reason a session with no copy
//   is, and the engine cannot tell those two apart.
//
// Batches are serial, one in flight, because the ids are this organization's
// data and the budget that bounds an audit of a large fortress is the same
// budget that keeps it from becoming an outage of it.
//
//   A BUDGET REFUSAL IS A WAIT, NOT A FAILURE. That same budget makes a sweep of
//   a large fortress arrive as more questions than any burst holds, so the hub
//   answers `retryAfterMs` and this waits it out rather than collapsing the run.
//   Without it the two properties above turn into a third, unintended one: above
//   roughly a burst's worth of batches the witness is never obtainable at all,
//   and the operator reads a rate limit as a broken hub.
