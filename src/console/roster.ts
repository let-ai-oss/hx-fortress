// The roster as this fortress keeps it: what one sync does to the table, and
// what ages out of it afterwards.
//
// THE REPLACE IS ONE TRANSACTION. A reader mid-sync sees the roster it had or
// the roster it is getting, never a half of each — the adoption funnel divides
// by the member count, and a denominator observed between two statements is a
// coverage figure nobody can reproduce.
//
// A DEPARTURE IS AN ABSENCE. The wire carries active members only, so this is
// where "not in the payload" becomes `active = false` with the date it was first
// noticed. The row stays: the sessions this host holds for that person did not
// leave with them, and the retention sweep — not the sync — is what eventually
// removes it.
