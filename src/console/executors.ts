// it. The executors return the sentence the console renders as the outcome, and
// throw with the sentence it renders as the failure; neither is invented by the
// console, which is what makes a reported outcome comparable against the
// daemon's own audit record.
//
// Nothing here is reached without the row already having been claimed through

// been validated against the per-kind shape.
