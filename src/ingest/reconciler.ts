// over each — rebuilding the row, turn/FTS indexes, tool_calls, session_facts,
// dimensions, embeddings (async, via signalEmbedWork), and the real title (the
// tier-A cascade). It also runs the title corrective pass over existing
// fallback/empty-title rows. This makes "canonical-without-row" a state the
// fortress cannot durably remain in, and — with Component C (which restores the
// known set WITH attribution first) — restores the existing backlog.
