// The CLI help registry.
//
// One structure, two consumers: `hx-fortress help` renders it in the terminal,
// and the console's Command Line panel renders the same entries in the browser.
// They were separate lists once; the browser one went stale within a release,
// because nothing fails when a panel forgets a verb.
//
// Every verb belongs here, including the ones a human rarely types.
