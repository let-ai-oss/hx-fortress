// FORTRESS_UI_BOOTSTRAP_USER — the first console account on a container that
// nobody can run a CLI verb inside yet.
//
// The variable is read by the SUPERVISOR and acted on by the CONSOLE, and the
// two are connected by a one-shot request file rather than by the environment
// they both already carry. The environment is present on every respawn; a
// console that acted on it directly would re-run the bootstrap after every crash
// and every `ui disable` flip, printing a fresh setup link into the container
// log each time. The request is written once per container boot, consumed as it
// is read, and gone.
//
// AN EXISTING LOGIN IS NEVER RESET HERE. On the second boot of a persistent
// volume the account already exists, so `ui user create` on it fails — and the
// answer is not to create it harder. Resetting it would mean anyone who can
// restart the container can mint a setup link for a live operator account, which
// is a takeover with a redeploy as its only prerequisite. The bootstrap says
// what the operator would have to run, and does nothing.
