// Assembling the read surface the console serves from.
//
// The handlers and the port were built to be testable without any of this: the
// port is an interface, and every dependency below is a function the port calls
// when it needs an answer. This module is the one place where those functions
// are the REAL ones — a live Postgres handle, the daemon's runtime files, the
// resolved configuration and the vault's own credential file.
//
// Two properties are deliberate and worth stating.
//
// NOTHING HERE THROWS ON A BROKEN FORTRESS. Every resolver answers with null,
// with an empty value or with a named degraded state, because the console's
// whole job on a broken fortress is to say what is broken. A mount that refused
// to build without Postgres would give an operator a blank page at exactly the
// moment they needed a diagnosis.
//
// THE DATABASE HANDLE IS LAZY AND RE-RESOLVED. The daemon writes pg.json on its
// first console-capable boot and provisions the console's role on every boot,
// so a console started first must pick both up without a restart — and a
// connection that fails is classified into the three distinct facts an operator
// can act on rather than one "database unavailable".
