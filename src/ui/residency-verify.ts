// Verifying ONE session, and refusing to say more than was checked.
//
// Three things can be asked about a session on this host: whether its metadata
// row is here, whether its transcript object is in the organization's bucket at
// the size the row claims, and whether any staging chunks were left behind by an
// upload that never composed. The fourth question - whether let.ai still holds a
// copy - is a CLOUD question, and this console does not ask it: the attested arm
// belongs to the task that owns the witness, so every verdict here reports the
// witness as NOT CHECKED rather than as clean.
//
// The proof text is built from the checks that actually ran. A dialog that
// printed the same five reassuring lines whatever it managed to do would be the
// green tick with nothing behind it, which is worse than no dialog at all.
