// Route classes, and the single gate every request passes through.
//
// Routes are classified BY EFFECT, not by URL shape or by who happens to call
// them today: `read` means no state changes anywhere — no store write, no
// filesystem write, no Postgres write, no ServiceManager call, no
// credential-bearing outbound request. Anything unclassified is `mutate`, so a
// route added without a decision is locked to operators rather than quietly open.
//
// The PUBLIC set is enumerated here and nowhere else, and the route-walk test
// compares the live registry against it member for member. A route that reaches
// the network before a session exists is a decision, never an accident.
//
// Only the public AUTH routes are spool-audited. The shell, the hashed assets,
// /healthz and the instance probe are not: they carry no principal and no
// intent, and logging them would let an unauthenticated flood grow a table that
// has no DELETE anywhere in the system.
//
// 401 BEFORE 404: an unauthenticated request to a path that does not exist is
// answered exactly like one to a path that does. Otherwise the difference between
// the two is a map of the console's surface, drawn by anyone who can reach it.
