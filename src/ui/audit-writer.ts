// What the CONSOLE writes to the spool: the acts a signed-in session took, the
// copies of fortress data that left, and the one thing in this system that is
// collapsed rather than recorded one-for-one.
//
// PUBLIC AUTH FAILURES COLLAPSE. An unauthenticated flood can produce attempts
// as fast as the network allows, and every record it produced would land in a
// table with no DELETE anywhere in the system - so the trail's size would become
// a function of how hard somebody attacked it, and the honest retention line
// ("the life of the database") would become a liability. One durable record per
// (login, remote-key, 5-minute window) carrying the final attempt count keeps
// growth proportional to ACTIVE PAIRS instead of attempts. Attempts refused by a
// rate bucket or by the global ceiling append NOTHING at all: they cost a
// counter, never an fsync, or a flood would still be able to make this host
// write to disk as fast as it can send packets.
//
// THE RECORD IS APPENDED ONCE, AT WINDOW CLOSE, WITH THE FINAL COUNT. Not
// amended in place - D7's spool is append-only, and an amend would rewrite
// evidence. Not re-appended under the same (fileId, seq) either: the drain is ON
// CONFLICT DO NOTHING on exactly that key, so a "corrected" second copy would be
// discarded in silence and the table would keep the stale count. An open window
// is closed on rotation and on shutdown; a crash loses at most the one open
// window, and the console says so rather than implying the trail is complete.
//
// EXPORTS ARE NEVER COLLAPSED. Each of the five gets its own record with its own
// parameters, because a trail that cannot say WHICH copy left is not a trail.
// They are human-initiated and cannot self-amplify, so the growth argument above
// does not apply; the bound is a per-session/day ceiling plus ONE marker.
