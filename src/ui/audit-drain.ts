// The drain: spool files into hx.admin_audit, and the two loud things that fall
// out of doing it.
//
// It runs as hx_ui, the only role that may INSERT here, and it is idempotent on
// (spool_file_id, seq) - so a file is read again at every boot until the
// retention floor lets it go, and a crash halfway through one costs nothing.
//
// PAYLOAD COMPARE. Idempotency alone would hide a rewritten record: ON CONFLICT
// DO NOTHING silently keeps whichever version arrived first. So a record whose
// key is already in the table is COMPARED against it, and a difference is raised
// as an audited integrity error rather than dropped. Two things produce one - a
// tampered spool file, and a writer that re-appended under a key it had already
// used - and both are bugs the operator has to see.
//
// DISPUTED IS RAISED HERE, and only here. The corroboration verdict is computed
// with the SAME exported ANY-MATCH predicate the read API renders from
// (corroborationOf), never a record-at-a-time comparison: a per-record
// evaluation cannot see the other records for a command id, so it would raise
// the loud alarm on exactly the crash-recovery re-drive that must read as
// confirmed - work done, crash before complete, boot re-drive completes with a
// second result. It cannot be raised from a request handler either: the read
// class is defined as having no state-changing effects and its effect test
// asserts it, so a handler that recorded an integrity error would fail its own
// class. The read path RENDERS the state; this path records it, once per
// command id.
