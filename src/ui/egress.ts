// Data paths in and out of this host.
//
// The panel used to be called "egress" and listed the flows somebody remembered.
// Both were wrong. It is not egress-only - the roster arrives, the relay carries
// questions inward - and a hand-kept list is a list that goes stale the release
// after it is written, silently, because nothing fails when a flow is missing
// from a page.
//
// So every row here is COMPUTED from effective configuration, and the two rows
// that enumerate call sites are diffed against the code that serves them: the
// relay row against the vault RPC switch, the outbound rows against the fetch
// call sites. A flow that exists and is not listed fails a test rather than
// misleading a reader.
//
// The rows say uncomfortable things where they are true. The console process
// holds a bucket-write-capable key, because the fortress has ONE credential for
// reads and writes; the metadata database carries transcript text and
// embeddings, whatever the console itself is allowed to read; and the relay row
// does not claim "never transcript objects", because two of the methods it
// serves stream exactly that.
