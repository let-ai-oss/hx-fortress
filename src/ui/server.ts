// The console's HTTP surface: a pure request handler plus a thin Bun.serve
// shell. Everything stateful rides in a context object, so the handler is
// unit-testable with plain Request values.
//
// Everything served here is data-free by construction — the app shell, its
// content-hashed assets, and a bare liveness probe. Nothing is authenticated
// because nothing here is private, and nothing here discloses the fortress
// either: no version, no org, no configuration. A peer that reaches the port
// before signing in learns that a console is listening and nothing else.
//
//   GET  /            → index.html
//   GET  /<view>      → index.html   (the app owns its routes; a cold deep link
//                                     must land where it says)
//   GET  /assets/*    → embedded static files
//   GET  /fonts/*     → embedded static files
//   GET  /healthz     → 200, empty    (platform health checks)
//   GET  /ui/api/instance → the identity handshake, loopback peers only
//   /ui/api/*         → 404 until a route claims it — an API namespace must
//                       never answer a fetch with the HTML shell
//
// The Host allowlist is enforced in the serve shell rather than here, because it
// re-reads ui.json per request and this handler is deliberately synchronous and
// stateless. /healthz and the instance handshake are exempt from THAT check
// alone: both answer before any name for this console exists. The handshake
// still passes the gate, so its meter and its loopback rule are the gate's like
// every other route's; /healthz passes nothing at all, deliberately — a platform
// probe that could be starved, or that could fail because a configuration file
// did not parse, is not a health check.
