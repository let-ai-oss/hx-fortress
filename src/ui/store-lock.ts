// The single-writer protocol for the console's two state files, <root>/ui/users.json
// and <root>/ui/ui.json.
//
// Both are read LIVE — the ui server re-reads them per request, the container
// supervisor per tick, the daemon per connection attempt — while the CLI writes
// them from a different process entirely. So a writer cannot simply rewrite the
// file: it takes an O_EXCL lock, re-reads under it, and renames a complete
// replacement into place with a monotonically increasing `version`. A concurrent
// writer that advanced the version between the read and the rename loses the CAS
// and retries, so no write is silently dropped.
//
// The lock is LIVENESS-AWARE, deliberately. A lock nobody can clear blocks
// sign-in, every CLI verb and the console's own enablement flip — worse than the
// interleaving it prevents. A lock whose owner is gone is reclaimed at once, one
// whose owner is merely slow only after it is provably older than any real
// critical section, and every reclaim is REPORTED so the caller can audit it.
// `--force-unlock` is the documented escape when even that is not enough.
//
// A file that does not parse is never rebuilt from a whitelist: the writer
// refuses and names the remediation. Rebuilding would silently drop the keys the
// parser does not know about — which on users.json means dropping accounts.
