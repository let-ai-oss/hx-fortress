// Rate buckets and lockout, and the two rules that shape both.
//
// RULE ONE — a lockout is never org-wide. Every counter is keyed on
// (login, remote-key), so an attacker who guesses at one account from one network
// cannot lock that account out for everybody else, and cannot lock out a
// colleague at all. The global term that does exist is a process-wide sign-in
// CEILING, which sheds load rather than denying a principal.
//
// RULE TWO — a remote is never hard-locked. Repeated failures buy an
// exponentially growing delay with a ceiling, not a permanent refusal: a
// permanent one is a denial-of-service an attacker can aim at the operator by
// failing on their behalf. `hx-fortress ui user reset` is the stated remedy for
// the case where the delay is not enough, and it clears state held in another
// process's memory by bumping the user's lockoutEpoch.
//
// Counters live in memory. They are hot — a flood touches them thousands of times
// a second — and users.json is the file `ui user disable` has to write; putting
// the two in one place would queue revocation behind an attack.
