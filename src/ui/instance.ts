// One console per fortress root.
//
// The rule is ROOT-scoped, not port-scoped: two consoles on the same <root> would
// both own users.json, both hold session tables the other cannot revoke, and both
// answer `ui disable` — a second instance on a different port is exactly as wrong
// as one on the same port. A port collision is a SEPARATE, secondary refusal with
// its own diagnosis, because the thing on that port may not be a console at all.
//
// The lockfile records {pid, bootId, startTicks|startTime, port}. Every field
// earns its place:
//
//   • pid alone is not identity — the kernel recycles pids, and a stale lock
//     naming a recycled pid would make a dead console look alive forever;
//   • bootId (the machine's, not this process's) invalidates every lock written
//     before a reboot, when no pid from the old boot can still be running;
//   • startTicks (or a start timestamp off /proc-less platforms) is what
//     distinguishes a recycled pid WITHIN one boot — the exact case bootId
//     cannot see, and the reason the field exists.
//
// The pid is also the signal source for `ui disable`, which is why it is written
// at acquisition rather than derived later from a process listing.
//
// UNLIKE hx's instance.ts there is no reuse handshake and no token reissue. The
// occupant probe returns a bare identity and nothing else; a console that handed
// a token to whoever asked would be a console with no sign-in at all.
