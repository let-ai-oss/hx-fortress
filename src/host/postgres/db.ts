//     @default 0 (no timeout)
//
// It is NOT an idle-connection reaper. It bounds how long a query may sit in the
// pool's CHECKOUT QUEUE before being rejected with ERR_POSTGRES_IDLE_TIMEOUT.
//
// v0.17.0 set it to 60 s believing it recycled idle sockets. The real effect: on
// a saturated pool every query queued for a full minute and then failed, and
// "ERR_POSTGRES_IDLE_TIMEOUT: Idle timeout reached after 1m" became the signature
// of the 2026-08-05 ingest outage. That error means POOL EXHAUSTION — never a
// dead connection — and `pg-errors.ts` classifies it accordingly.
//
// The only correct calibration is against the caller's own deadline: the vault
// RPC abandons at FORTRESS_DB_RPC_DEADLINE_MS (default 25 s). This bound must be
// long enough to ride out a normal burst, and short enough that real exhaustion
// is rejected while the caller is still listening — a queue that outlives every
// request in it is pure waste that keeps the pool busy for the NEXT request too.

// statement_timeout. Without a separate, much shorter lock_timeout a live chunk
// queued behind a long same-session restore holds one of the pool's connections
// for the WHOLE 120 s statement budget while doing no work at all.
//
// That is the connection hoard that turned one slow commit into a pool-wide
// outage: the vault RPC gave up at 25 s but never cancels, so the blocked
// transaction kept its connection for the remaining ~95 s; the cloud then
// replayed the commit, and the replay queued behind it on the same lock. Failing
// the lock wait fast (SQLSTATE 55P03, tagged as SessionLockTimeoutError) makes

// making it structurally impossible to spend the live ingest budget.

//
// The shared 120 s budget is right for the read path (hx_text_occurrences is a

// transcript replayed in one transaction). It is badly wrong for live ingest,
// because the vault RPC abandons at FORTRESS_DB_RPC_DEADLINE_MS (25 s) and
// racePgPhase never cancels: a commit nobody is waiting for any more kept its
// pooled connection for up to another 95 s. That is why, once lock contention
// was removed, the dominant remaining failure in production was the pool's own
// acquire bound — connections held by transactions that had already lost their
// caller.
//
// 30 s sits just ABOVE the RPC deadline, so the caller still wins the race and
// returns a typed error, and the server then reclaims the connection ~5 s later
// instead of ~95 s. Live chunks are deltas measured in milliseconds, so this is
// enormous headroom for them. The one shape that can exceed it — a
// whole-transcript writeCanonical producer — is exactly the shape whose failure
// path is already safe: the canonical is persisted first, the RPC acks anyway,
// and the guarantor rebuilds the index on the BACKGROUND pool, which keeps the
// long budget. Fully or not at all, with the safety net doing the retry.
