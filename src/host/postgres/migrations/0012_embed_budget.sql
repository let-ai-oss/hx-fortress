-- 0012 · durable daily OpenAI embed-token budget (M-9e). One row per UTC day
-- accumulates the estimated tokens the embed worker has sent to OpenAI; the
-- worker reads today's spend before a pass and stops claiming for the day once
-- it crosses FORTRESS_EMBED_DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET. Durable so the ceiling survives a
-- restart (an in-memory counter would reset and blow the budget on every crash).
