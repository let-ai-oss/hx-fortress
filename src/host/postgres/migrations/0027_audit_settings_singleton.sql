-- `hx.audit_settings` is described everywhere as a singleton and was never
-- constrained to be one.
--
-- 0015 created it with a single column and no primary key; the reader takes
-- `LIMIT 1` with no ORDER BY, and the writer is an UPDATE followed by an
-- INSERT-if-zero-rows — a read-modify-write with no uniqueness underneath it. Two
-- concurrent flips therefore leave two rows with different `changed_at` /
-- `changed_by`, and the reader picks whichever the planner hands back first. That
-- destroys exactly the accountability stamp 0025 exists to provide: the setter
-- cannot be fenced (the daemon and a leaked roles.json present the same Postgres
-- role), so knowing WHO last changed it is the whole compensating control.
--
-- The shape the next migration already uses (`0018_roster.sql`'s roster_sync) is
-- the one this should have had. De-duplicate first, keeping the newest stamp,
-- then constrain — so an install that already has two rows converges rather than
-- failing to migrate.
-- KEEP-ONE, chosen deterministically. A pairwise `a.ctid < b.ctid AND
-- a.changed_at <= b.changed_at` deletes only the rows dominated on BOTH axes, so
-- whenever physical order disagrees with stamp order it deletes nothing and the
-- primary key below then fails — permanently, because `runMigrations` records a
-- migration only after its batch succeeds, so every later boot re-runs this one
-- and no corrective migration can ever be reached.
