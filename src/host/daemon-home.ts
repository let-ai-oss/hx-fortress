// Where the daemon's HOME is, decided ONCE, at boot, by name.
//
// credentials.json lives under `$HOME/.let/session-vault/`, resolved on every
// call — deliberately, so a re-homed process writes where it was re-homed to.
// That is right for a service and wrong for exactly one situation: a container
// whose HOME moved between image versions. The file is on the volume; $HOME
// names a directory that is not.
//
// This is the only place that is allowed to answer it, and it answers by
// SETTING HOME once, before anything reads or writes a credential.
//
// WHY NOT INSIDE readVaultCredentials. Two reasons, either sufficient:
//
//   • that function is a pure read reachable from a read-class console handler,
//     and the route classes are enforced by a test that forbids a read route
//     from having an effect. Re-homing the process IS an effect;
//   • it would race applyHeadlessBootstrap. The bootstrap REBUILDS
//     credentials.json from the environment, so a walk that ran lazily — on
//     whichever read happened first — could adopt a home after the file had
//     already been written to a different one, and the boot would end with two
//     credential files and the wrong one live.
//
// So: one call, at the top of the daemon's boot, before the bootstrap runs.
