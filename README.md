# hx-fortress

HX Fortress is the on-customer-infrastructure host for let.ai components. It
runs as a long-lived Bun process, owns the connection to let.ai cloud, and
loads component modules such as `session_vault`.

This repository currently contains the vendored Fortress/cloud protocol
boundary, the host runtime with its stable on-disk configuration and status
contracts, and the lifecycle CLI for running Fortress as a persistent per-user
launchd or systemd service. Structured logs, module loading, and cloud
transport are implemented. Release artifacts bundle the core `session_vault`
module; `update` and the installer remain follow-up tasks.

## Install

The distribution installer will be served from the customer's let.ai
Workbench origin:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://<workbench-origin>/install/hx-fortress.sh | sh
```

## Commands

The Fortress CLI surface is:

```text
hx-fortress start
hx-fortress stop
hx-fortress status
hx-fortress logs
hx-fortress update
```

`hx-fortress host` is the internal foreground command used by the OS service
manager. It is not intended for direct user invocation.

## Cloud-service run mode

`hx-fortress host` also runs headless as a let.ai cloud service — no TUI, no
interactive enroll wizard. A container started with only environment variables
and an empty mounted volume enrolls into the hub on first boot and serves the
gateway. The Dockerfile sets `FORTRESS_ROOT=/data` and `ENTRYPOINT
["hx-fortress", "host"]`; mount a volume at `/data` so `config.json`,
`credentials.json`, and the signing key persist across restarts (restarts
re-`hello` with the saved credential instead of re-enrolling).

### Environment contract

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `FORTRESS_ROOT` | yes (Docker) | Directory for persisted state. The image sets `/data`. |
| `FORTRESS_PUBLIC_URL` | yes | Public URL of the ingest gateway; also enables the gateway. |
| `FORTRESS_GATEWAY_PORT` | no | Gateway listen port (default `8787`). |
| `FORTRESS_ENROLL_TOKEN` | first boot | One-time enrollment token from the let.ai hub. |
| `FORTRESS_CLOUD_URL` | first boot | WebSocket URL of the hub, e.g. `wss://let.ai/api/fortress/tunnel`. |
| `FORTRESS_STORAGE_BUCKET` | yes | Bucket that holds session transcripts. |
| `FORTRESS_STORAGE_KIND` | no | `gcs` (default) or `s3`. |
| `FORTRESS_STORAGE_REGION` | no | Bucket location / region. |
| `FORTRESS_GCS_PROJECT_ID` | gcs | GCP project id. |
| `FORTRESS_GCS_SA_KEY` | no (gcs) | Service-account key JSON, raw or base64-encoded. Omit to use application default credentials. |
| `FORTRESS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | no (s3) | S3 access key id. Omit to use the AWS default credential chain. |
| `FORTRESS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | no (s3) | S3 secret access key. |
| `FORTRESS_S3_SESSION_TOKEN` | no (s3) | S3 session token. |
| `FORTRESS_S3_ENDPOINT` | no (s3) | S3-compatible endpoint (MinIO, R2, …). |
| `FORTRESS_S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | no (s3) | `true` for path-style addressing. |

`FORTRESS_ENROLL_TOKEN` + `FORTRESS_CLOUD_URL` are consumed only on the first
boot of a fresh volume; once a credential is saved they are ignored. Storage
credentials are re-applied from the environment on every boot, so rotating a key
is a redeploy.

### Health checks

- `GET /healthz` — liveness; `200 {"ok":true}` as soon as the gateway listens.
- `GET /readyz` — readiness; `200 {"ok":true,"ready":true}` once the vault store
  is live, otherwise `503`. Point the platform's traffic gate here.

## Development

Install Bun, then run:

```sh
bun install
bun test
bun run typecheck
bun run lint
```

Use `bun run check` to run all repository checks in the same order as CI.
